** Disable the Dalle script on the canvas if testing the project. Each request costs 8 cents.

You will need an api key for the google text to speech api and the open ai api. You will also need to replace where the project gets the api keys from in the code.

If controller is not working:
1. Go to Window -> SteamVR Input in Unity
2. Go to Open Binding UI
3. Edit current binding
4. Replace the triggers binding with 'triggeraction'
5. Save the new binding
